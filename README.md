## üß∞ DevOps Workflow

### 1. üåê EKS Provisioning with eksctl
- EKS cluster and node groups are provisioned using `eksctl` configuration files.
- ELB is automatically created and attached via Kubernetes `Service` of type `LoadBalancer`.

### 2. ‚öíÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
- GitHub webhook triggers Jenkins pipeline automatically.
- Pipeline steps:
  - Clone repository
  - Owasp Dependency Check
  - Sonarqube Scan
  - Build Docker image
  - Push to Docker Hub
  - Connect to EKS
  - Deploy updated image using Helm

### 3. üì¶ Kubernetes Deployment
- Helm manages deployment of:
  - Flask backend app
- Application is exposed externally via **AWS ELB** provisioned by a `LoadBalancer` service in Kubernetes.
